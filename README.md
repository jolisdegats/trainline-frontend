<h1>Trainline copycat (React)</h1>
<br/>
<p> Technical Frontend test I made in a week. The goal was to redo Trainline's homepage using 3 API (popular cities, popular cities from and autocomplete). For this project I created a Custom State Manegement tool (thanks to Steven Persia's twitch session here) and a date picker from scratch based on this tutorial.</p><p>
This demo of the project is currently hosted on Netlify (frontend). Have a look at the live demo below and feel free to give me some feedback. </p>
