<h1>Trainline copycat (React)</h1>
<br/>
<p> Technical frontend test I took in a week. The goal was to redo Trainline's homepage using 3 API (popular cities, popular cities from and autocomplete). For this project I created a Custom State Management tool and a date picker from scratch based on <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/build-a-date-picker-in-15mins-using-javascript-react-from-scratch-f6932c77db09">this tutorial</a>.</p><p>
The demo of the project is currently hosted on Netlify (frontend). Have a look at it and feel free to give some feedback. </p>
